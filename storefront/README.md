# LiquorCentral Storefront

The customer-facing Next.js storefront for [LiquorCentral.ng](../README.md), wired to `backend/apps/backend`'s Store API.

This is **engineering output**, not planning documentation. The authoritative source of truth for what this storefront must do is `/docs` — see in particular `docs/TECH_STACK.md`, `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`, and the eleven frozen `docs/specifications/`. Nothing here should contradict those documents; if it ever does, the documentation wins and the code is the bug.

## What this is

Medusa's official **DTC Starter** storefront app (`apps/storefront` extracted from `https://github.com/medusajs/dtc-starter`, the actively-maintained successor to the now-deprecated `nextjs-starter-medusa` repository), per `TECH_STACK.md`'s "Next.js Starter (\"DTC Starter\")" recommendation. Only the storefront app was taken from that repository — its own bundled `apps/backend` was discarded, since this project already has its own fully custom Medusa backend at `backend/apps/backend` (the two share the `@dtc/backend` package name, confirming this project's `backend/` was itself originally scaffolded from the same starter family).

This milestone is a **scaffold, not a redesign**: it proves the storefront runs and talks to the real backend (real Nigeria region, real publishable API key, real Store API calls) using the starter's own out-of-the-box UI, unmodified. Applying `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`/`BRAND_IDENTITY.md`'s actual colors, typography, and component patterns is separate, later work (`ROADMAP.md` Phase 0c, component specification) — not attempted here, since inventing UI ahead of that phase would be exactly the kind of unauthorized product/UI decision this project's engineering discipline avoids.

## What's configured

- **Package versions pinned to match the backend exactly** — `@medusajs/js-sdk`, `@medusajs/icons`, `@medusajs/types` at `2.17.2`; `eslint` bumped to `8.57.1` to satisfy `eslint-config-next`'s actual peer requirement (the starter's own pin was stale). No version drift between backend and storefront.
- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_REGION=ng`** and a real publishable API key scoped to the "LiquorCentral Storefront" sales channel (created via the Admin API, linked to the sales channel Milestone 1 seeded) — not the template's placeholder Denmark/`pk_test` defaults.
- **Yarn** (`packageManager: yarn@1.22.22`, matching `backend/apps/backend`'s exact pin) — the starter's own monorepo used pnpm, but since this app was extracted as a standalone, non-monorepo package, Yarn keeps tooling consistent with the rest of this project rather than introducing a second package manager.

## Known engineering fixes (mechanical, not business decisions)

A handful of narrow type-safety and lint issues in the vendored template were fixed — all mechanical (null-guards, a stricter type shape, an unused suppression comment), none touching business logic or UI:

- `src/lib/data/cart.ts` — `setAddresses`' dynamically-built `data`/`billing_address` objects (built field-by-field from `FormData`, which can technically hand back a `File`) now cast through `unknown` rather than `any`, satisfying `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`; three `catch (e: any)` blocks narrowed to `catch (e)` with an `instanceof Error` check; two placeholder gift-card functions' unused params prefixed with `_` (their real logic is commented out upstream — this project has no approved gift-card feature, so it stays untouched, not implemented).
- `src/modules/checkout/components/shipping/index.tsx` — the `Shipping` component's prop type widened from `StoreCartShippingOption` to `StoreCartShippingOptionWithServiceZone` (the type the `/store/shipping-options` endpoint actually returns, confirmed against `@medusajs/types`' own response type) so `service_zone` resolves; `formatAddress` narrowed to a minimal structural type covering only the fields it reads, resolving a `StoreFulfillmentAddress` vs. `StoreCartAddress` `phone` nullability mismatch.
- `src/modules/common/components/line-item-price/index.tsx`, `line-item-unit-price/index.tsx` — `total`/`original_total` defaulted to `0` when `undefined`.
- `src/modules/layout/components/country-select/index.tsx` — `CountryOption`'s `country`/`label` fields widened to optional (matching what a region with a missing ISO code or display name can actually produce), with a guard in `handleChange`.
- `src/modules/layout/components/language-select/index.tsx` — two `@ts-ignore` comments (flagged by lint as needing `@ts-expect-error`) removed entirely once bumping `eslint`/pinning React 19 types confirmed there was no longer a real type error underneath them.

## Local development

Prerequisites: the backend (`backend/apps/backend`) running locally on port 9000, with a Nigeria region and a publishable API key linked to a sales channel (see `backend/README.md`).

```bash
# from storefront/
cp .env.template .env.local
# fill in NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_PUBLISHABLE_KEY (create one via the Admin API or
# dashboard, linked to the backend's sales channel) and set
# NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_REGION=ng to match the backend's seeded Nigeria region

yarn install
yarn dev      # http://localhost:8000
# or, for a production build:
yarn build && yarn start
```

Validated end to end against the real backend: `tsc --noEmit` and `yarn lint` both clean; `yarn build` succeeds; the homepage and `/ng/store` listing both return `200` and render using real Store API data (empty product/collection results are expected — no catalog data has been seeded yet).

## What's deliberately not here yet

- **Any LiquorCentral branding, design tokens, or custom UI** — this milestone validates the connection only; `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`/`BRAND_IDENTITY.md` application is separate, later work.
- **A real payment provider** — the storefront's checkout flow exists (from the starter) but has nothing to connect to yet; `TIER_B_LOCAL_PAYMENT_PROVIDER_MODULE.md`'s provider choice remains an open business decision.
- **Any product/catalog data** — no products have been seeded; pages render correctly with empty results.
- **Delivery-slot selection UI** — the backend's `delivery-slot` module (Milestone 4) has no storefront-facing UI yet; `07_CHECKOUT_SPECIFICATION.md`'s calendar-grid slot picker is unbuilt.
